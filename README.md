This project is about optimizing the process parameters of L-PBF for Inconel 718 spur gears like laser power, scan speed,  and layer thickness utilising central composite design (CCD) and ANOVA in Minitab.
The ANN model is developed in MATLAB to predict the yield strength, performing regression analysis and graphing results to visualize data.
