• Analyzed the gear simulations in Paraview using graphs and algorithms to get the stress distribution and displacement at different points
• Developed a logistic regression model to predict the threshold stress value, trained and tested over 4 datasets with 1 lakh+ datapoints
• Created a co-relation matrix between the stresses acting in different directions of the gear and identified their probability distribution
